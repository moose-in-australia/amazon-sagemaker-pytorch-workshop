    "# Custom Models with PyTorch - Advanced Amazon SageMaker Workshop\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the built-in algorithms provided by Amazon SageMaker are useful, sometimes it is necessary to write custom algorithms. In this workshop, you will learn how to write custom algorithms while taking advantage of all the features offered by Amazon SageMaker, including training jobs, hyperparameter tuning jobs, and debugger. This workshop is just a primer meant to get you started; there are too many features to cover in a couple of hours. \n",

The code required to deploy the model could be included in `sagemaker_pytorch_mnist.py`, but in this case we will store it in a separate file called `serve_pytorch_mnist.py` which has already been placed in the `scripts` folder of this workshop.

    "Notice that the script includes the same convolutional neural network build as the training script. However, the key method to understand is the `model_fn()` method. Amazon SageMaker model serving defines four methods which you can use to manipulate the behavior of the deployed model:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `model_fn`: Takes a model directory and loads the model artifacts into an estimator object.\n",
    "* `input_fn` (*optional*): Takes request data and deserializes the data into an object for prediction.\n",
    "* `predict_fn` (*optional*): Takes the deserialized request object and performs inference against the loaded model.\n",
    "* `output_fn` (*optional*): Takes the result of prediction and serializes this according to the response content type.\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods can be completely customized based on your needs. The `input_fn`, `predict_fn`, and `output_fn` methods have default implementations in the SageMaker PyTorch model server. You only need to include these methods if you want to modify the default implementation. However, the `model_fn` method must always be defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're happy with the serving script, you can use the code below to set up a SageMaker endpoint. Hopefully, at this point, at least one of your training jobs has finished. You'll need to find the S3 URI of the model artifact for the model you want to deploy. It should look like: `s3://<bucket-name>/.../model.tar.gz`. This URI can be found through the console or through code in this notebook - it is up to you to pick a method, figure out how to find the URI, and insert it in the code below."
