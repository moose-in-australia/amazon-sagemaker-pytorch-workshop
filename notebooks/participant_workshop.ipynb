You'll need to find the S3 URI of the model artifact for the model you want to deploy. It should look like: `s3://<bucket-name>/.../model.tar.gz`. This URI can be found through the console or through code in this notebook - it is up to you to pick a method, figure out how to find the URI, and insert it in the code below."
